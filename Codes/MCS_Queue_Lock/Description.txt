# DESCRIPTION
- The task is to simulate printing in a bus network using concurrent programming.
- A bus network is a local area network (LAN) topology in which each node, a workstation or other device, is connected to a main cable or link called a bus.
- All connected stations on the bus can communicate with all others on the singular network segment.
- This bus network follows a specific procedure to ensure the integrity of the communication between nodes.

# MCS Queue Lock
- In order to mitigate the issue of mixed print-work by the printer in the network, only one other node on the network is allowed to broadcast a print request to the printer at any given time. The process of printing is as follow:
    - All nodes have to stand in a queue to print. There are 5 different nodes in the network excluding the printer. Each node must send at least 5 print request to the printer.
    - Each node can only send a single print request at a time.
    - When a node attempts to print some material it stands in a queue if there is one,otherwise it can just submit the request.
- Note:
    - A thread will simulate a node and the printer will be the critical section.
    - Once a nodes' print request is first in the queue, the thread will sleep for a randomly selected amount of time between 200 and 1000 milliseconds before exiting.
- Output
    - The following output is expected:
        - When a node ATTEMPTS to print some material, the following will need to be
            output:[Thread-Name][Request-Number] printing request.
        - When a nodes' request has been RECEIVED by the printer, the following will need to be
            output:[Thread-Name][Request-Number] printing [random-message].
        - When a nodes' printing is DONE, the following will need to be output:
            QUEUE:{[Thread-Name]:[Request-Number]}->....
            Example:QUEUE:{Thread-1:Request 1}->{Thread-2:Request 1}
            Note:This is the print request queue
    - Note that you will have to be creative in printing the queue. Hint: consider using the qnode to store the information.
    - Start-up code.
        class Qnode {
            boolean locked = false;
            qnode next = null;
        }
        class MCSLock implements Lock {
            AtomicReference tail;
            public void lock() {
                // Make a QNode
                Qnode qnode = new Qnode();
                // add my Node to the tail of queue
                Qnode pred = tail.getAndSet(qnode);
                // Fix if queue was non-empty
                if (pred != null) {
                    qnode.locked = true;
                    pred.next = qnode;
                    // Wait until unlocked
                    while (qnode.locked) {}
                }
            }
            public void unlock() {
                // Missing successor?
                if (qnode.next == null) {
                    // If really no successor, return
                    if (tail.CAS(qnode, null)) {
                        return;
                    }
                    // Otherwise wait for successor to catch up
                    while (qnode.next == null) {}
                }
                // Pass lock to successor
                qnode.next.locked = false;
            }
        }

# Time-out Lock
    - The following needs to be completed:
        - The MCS Queue Lock from the previous task needs to be replaced by a Time-outLock
        - Implement your Time-out Lock inside aTimeout class.
        - Change the simulation you have created to make use of the Time-out instead of the MCS Queue.
        - The output remains the same as Task 1.
    - Note: Select a timeout based on the acceptable time a node should wait/spend in printing request.
    - Start-up code.
        public class TOLock implements Lock {
            // Distinguished node to signify free lock
            static Qnode AVAILABLE = new Qnode();
            // Tail of the queue
            AtomicReference<Qnode> tail;
            // Remember my node ...
            ThreadLocal<Qnode> myNode;

            public boolean lock(long timeout) {
                // Create & initialize node
                Qnode qnode = new Qnode();
                myNode.set(qnode);
                qnode.prev = null;
                // Swap with tail
                Qnode myPred = tail.getAndSet(qnode);
                // If predecessor absent or released, we are done
                if (myPred== null || myPred.prev == AVAILABLE) {
                    return true;
                }
                long start = now();
                // Keep trying for a while ...
                while (now()- start < timeout) {
                    // Spin on predecessor's prev field
                    Qnode predPred = myPred.prev;
                    // Predecessor released lock
                    if (predPred == AVAILABLE) {
                        return true;
                    } else if (predPred != null) { // Predecessor aborted, advance one
                        myPred = predPred;
                    }
                }
                // Do I have a successor? If CAS fails: I do have a successor, tell it about myPred
                if (!tail.compareAndSet(qnode, myPred)) {
                    qnode.prev = myPred;
                }
                // If CAS succeeds: no successor, simply return false
                return false;
            }
            public void unlock() {
                Qnode qnode = myNode.get();
                // If CAS failed: exists successor, notify successor it can enter
                // CAS successful: set tail to null, no clean up since no successor waiting
                if (!tail.compareAndSet(qnode, null)) {
                    qnode.prev = AVAILABLE;
                }
            }
